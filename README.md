## Project Description  
An interactive, web-based life simulation game where every story is unique. Users create a character, choose perks, and make choices that guide their life, with all narratives, events, and outcomes dynamically generated by Google's Gemini AI.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
The crushing predictability of real life. You wake up, you work, you sleep. Where's the chance to be a charismatic, athletic, genius billionaire who also has a kind heart? We needed a way to escape this mundane reality without the hassle of, you know, actually doing anything.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
A fully AI-powered life simulator! We've outsourced the hard work of living to a large language model. Now you can experience the highs and lows of a completely random life, from discovering a love for puzzles as a toddler to... well, whatever the AI decides comes next. It's all the drama with none of the consequences.
